        	<p>Music is being used in more places than ever before these days. Whether its toys, musical greeting cards or lyric reprints in apparel, consumer goods manufacturers are tapping into the strength of people’s emotional connections with individual songs to create hugely popular products. BMEG Music Publishing is leading the way, partnering with merchandising businesses across the world and can work with you to help develop your brand or product.</p> 
            <p>We know that speed in getting to market is of the essence when coming up with a winning product, and as a result, we’re used to working to tight deadlines to help you achieve your goals. Of course, the world of music licensing is often a difficult one to navigate through, with no two deals being quite the same. So we’ve developed a range of high quality cover versions, as well as pre-cleared and easy-to-clear tracks, to ensure that the licensing process can move as quickly as you need it to.</p>
            <p>Our dedicated merchandising specialists around the world will work with you to help you find exactly the right song for your product. We’ll make full use of the 1.3 million songs in our catalogue spanning all eras and genres in order to get the perfect fit. We’ve got many years of experience in licensing songs for use in anything from cuddly toys to carriage clocks, and no request is too strange for us to consider. We’re here to help and will work with you through every step to make sure that you get the license you need, when you need it.
Great songs make great products. Start your next merchandising project with the world’s greatest catalog of songs at your fingertips, with BMEG Music Publishing.</p>
