				<p>BMEG Music is a global music publishing company and contains one of the world's greatest collections of musical compositions, ranging from well-known standards to new songs by emerging artists.</p>	
                <p>BMEG is a leader in the creation of innovative strategies for the marketing and promotion of songwriters and their music and, in 2007, won its sixth consecutive SESAC "Publisher of the Year Award." That same year, BMEG announced a partnership with rock band Radiohead to create a first-of-its-kind rights clearance strategy for the digital release of the album, In Rainbows. In 2006, the company launched its Pan-European Digital Licensing (PEDL) initiative, which is driving collection societies across Europe to adopt simpler, one-stop licenses for BMEG songs used by digital music services.</p>

                <p>BMEG dates its origins back to 1811 and the formation of Chappell & Company, a music publishing house and instrument store on London's Bond Street, making it the oldest company in the WMG family. Its legendary music publishing catalog makes BMEG a natural first stop for A&R executives and record producers, feature film and television production companies and others looking to record or license some of the world's greatest music. We also administer the music and soundtracks of several third-party television and film producers and studios, including Lucasfilm, Ltd., Hallmark Entertainment and Disney Music Publishing.</p>
